    <h2>Love Fried Rice? Here's how with this simple Fried Rice Recipe.</h2>

    <p>The recipe for fried rice is simple. You may even have these ingridients at home around your kitchen: chicken, beef, shrimp? Okay, shrimp is a bit too expensive to keep around these days, but you get the point.
        Also, you would need a good quality of rice, at least in my book. Look to your local Asian supermarket for these different types of rices. Some soy sauce, other sauces, a wok, and boom there we go. Remeber to cook the rice a day in advance. It tastes so much better
        when you do!
    </p>
    
    <p>Okay, let's actually itemize the list of ingridients you need for the best fried rice.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Jasmine Rice, I personally use this kind.</li>
        <li>Garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>Protein of your choice</li>
        <li>Peas and Carrots</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Oyster Sauce</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>Green Onions</li>
    </ul>

<p>Okay, so here is how you actually create the best fried rice:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Step 1, cook the rice a day in advance. I don't know why fried rice tastes better after a day, but after testing both fresh cooked and cold rice, cold rice is better.</li>
    <li>Step 2, oil your wok (or pan) with seasme oil. When the wok gets to medium heat, scramble your eggs and put them to the side. </li>
    <li>Step 3, sautee the chopped garlic, peas and carrots, and white parts of the green onions. Sautee them for at least 1-2 mins.</li>
    <li>Step 4, add your rice and sautee for about 1-2mins. Add your soy sauce and oyster sauce and sautee for an additional 1 minute on high heat.</li>
    <li>When done, chop some of the green onion to garnish on top! And you have your fried rice!</li>
</ol>
